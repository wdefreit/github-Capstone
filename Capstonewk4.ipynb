Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem."

    "Traffic in south Florida is horrible. Motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of traffic. In 2018, the state, recorded 399,652 crashes statewide and 40,724 crashes in Broward county alone. Distracted driving is known to be correlated with traffic incidents and resulted in an almost national ban on texting and driving around 2009. \n",

    "This project will leverage the Foursquare location data to explore the extent to which venues such as fast food restaurants, coffee shops, or other takeout establishments contribute to traffic accidents in Broward County, Florida.  The working hypothesis is that more accidents take place closer to establishments where a person can purchase food and beverages and eat or drink while driving. \n",

This information may also be of interest to venues in determining whether the characteristics of their take-out food and beverage items should change to reduce accidents. Thus, the audience for this project are legislators and entities that sell take-out food and beverage items.  \n"

So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data."

If it does, then we will try to further explore whether accidents occur more frequently around certain of these establishments. Perhaps, there are similarities or differences in the items people purchase that could be explored in subsequent projects.     \n"
